This project originated in 2020, the year the South Philadelphia refinery complex permanently closed, which also happened to be the year principal investigator Jared Farmer joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, Farmer began teaching courses on Pennsylvania fossil fuel history and began doing collaborative research with students. Over time, the primary output of Farmer’s “Petrodelphia” project came into focus: A freely accessible public-facing website for collecting and curating historical sources about the lower Schuylkill River petrochemical corridor, and for sharing scholarship that synthesizes that information. With technical help from Penn Libraries, Farmer launched this website in 2025, in advance of the US Semiquincentennial (250th anniversary) in Philadelphia.

<h1>How to use this site</h1>

There are any number of ways to use this site—no right or wrong way. If you want to start by reading, the best entry point is probably <a href="reference.html#summary">"Reckoning with Fossil Fuel in Philadelphia,”</a> located under the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> tab. This summary document includes a detailed timeline of the petrochemical corridor. Another textual entry point is the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>, which offers definitions of many names, terms, conceps, and acronyms that appear throughout this website.

Alternatively, before diving deeply into this website, you may wish to watch one or more external videos related to the South Philadelphia refinery complex: <a href="https://archive.org/details/71402TheAtlanticStory" target="_blank"">The Atlantic Story</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhGmHlrbYa0" target="_blank">A City Divided: Philadelphia's Energy Hub</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkOl5tIwxxU" target="_blank">Midnight Oil</a>; or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc8qXTh6tTY&t=1s" target="_blank">Wake Up Call: Refinery Disaster in Philadelphia</a>.


After that, consider these pathways:

<div class="container my-4 mx-4">
    <h2>Reference articles</h2>
        <p>Read one or more of the six encyclopedia-style articles, which range in length from 7,500 to 20,000 words. Each of these articles (under the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> tab) includes a bibliography. Readers lacking background in fossil fuel history may want to peruse the two shortest articles: <a href="reference.html#penna-coal">“Pennsylvania Coal and Philadelphia”</a> and <a href="reference.html#petro-industry">“Petroleum Industry and Greater Philadelphia.”</a> Others may prefer to go straight to the longest article: <a href="reference.html#south-philly-refinery">“South Philadelphia Refinery Complex.”</a> All the reference works can be downloaded.</p>
    <h2>Historic images</h2>
        <p>Visual learners may choose to begin by browsing 200+ downloadable images, grouped into five collection types: 1) architectural, 2) low-angle views, 3) aerial views, 4) newspaper headlines, and 5) news photography. All of them are tagged under the genre “image.” You can search for specific images using geographic or descriptive keywords that you encounter in the reference works. For example: ARCO, Atlantic Refining, bridge, DuPont, Center City, explosion, expressway, fire, firefighters, Gibson Point, Girard Point, Grays Ferry, Gulf, incinerator, north yard, Passyunk Avenue, PGW, pollution, Quartermaster Depot, Point Breeze, Schuylkill River, storage tank, tanker ship, Tasker Homes, Yankee Point, and so on.</p>
    <h2>Explore collections</h2>
        To do original research in primary and secondary sources related to the lower Schuylkill petrochemical corridor, you can browse 400+ downloadable documents, including “grey literature” (e.g., environmental remediation reports and government documents). These texts have been grouped into sixteen collection types:

    <h2>Targeted searching</h2>
        <p>Use the website’s search bar for targeted searching by keyword, personal name, place name, year, etc. This will work for texts as well as images.</p>
    <h2>Chronological browsing</h2>
        <p>Browse all the items, both texts and images, chronologically.</p>
    <h2>Lesson plans</h2>
        <p>Read the <a href="lessons.html">lesson plans</a>, which have been designed for social studies teachers at the elementary, middle, and high school levels in Greater Philadelphia. The curriculum may also be of interest to college educators anywhere who offer courses on energy history, energy policy, environmental justice, labor history, urban environmental history, city planning, or the built environment. The lesson plans could also could be pertinent, in a comparative way, for residents, activists, and planners in other urban zones with legacy refineries (e.g., Linden, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Richmond, California).</p>
    <h2>Interactive maps</h2>
        <p>Explore the two mapping tools:</p>
        <div class="container my-4 mx-4">
        <li><a href="layered-map.html">Layered maps</a> consists of planar (top-down) aerial photographs, satellite images, and a variety of published maps. The historic date range runs from 1867 (just after the formation of Atlantic Petroleum Storage Company) to 2019 (the year the former Atlantic refinery exploded for the last time). There are also up-to-date maps and satellite views. All the cartographic scans have been georeferenced and georectified (pinned and aligned) for easy comparison. Atop each base map you can overlay visual information like ZIP Codes, zoning boundaries, census data, and the “Areas of Interest” (environmental remediation zones) that comprise the former refinery complex. There are also future-oriented overlays that visualize risk scenarios for “100-year floods” and sea-level rise related to global warming. By layering and unlayering, and by zooming in and zooming out, you can see how the built environment has changed over time, and appreciate how those changes relate to social and physical factors. These layered maps have inherent visual interest, but you will gain more from them as you learn about Philadelphia and its fossil fuel history from the textual side of the website.</li>
        <li><a href="accident-map.html">Accident mapper</a> allows you to see when and where 188 known petrochemical accidents occurred along the lower Schuylkill River, as superimposed on a current map. The date range is 1866 to 2019. Each dot represents one accident. The color red indicates fatal; orange indicates injurious; and blue indicates non-injurious. Zoom in until you can distinguish individual dots, then click on any one to see associated information. (Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using underlying data. <a href="browse.html#data%20sheet">Browse the genre tag "data sheets"</a> for a pair of sheets — one listing injurious accidents and another listing total accidents. A third sheet with data on accident victims is available to professional researchers on request.)</li>

One large class of primary sources crucial to the "Petrodelphia" project cannot be included here: proprietary scans from ProQuest Historical Newspapers and Newspapers.com. Serious researchers may want to use such subscription services to supplement this website.

Much of the information on this website was compiled by student research assistants from newspaper accounts. Journalists, past and present, are known to make mistakes—and researchers are fallible, too. It is inevitable, despite fact-checking, that a certain number of errors persist. Readers are encouraged to do follow-up research. Indeed, this public-facing digital history project has been designed to aid just that.

The deepest purpose of “Petrodelphia” is to inspire and facilitate scholarship, storytelling, and sharing. Many important stories about America’s first petrochemical corridor remain to be told.
